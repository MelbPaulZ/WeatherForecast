# WeatherForecast

This is a demo project of showing Android knowledge, the purpose is for internship application.

For this sample application, I have used following technology.

`
1. Databinding
2. RxJava
3. Retrofit
4. MVP (Model-View-Presenter) + ViewModel project structure
5. Reflection (In order to simplify codes)
6. Some thrid party libraries
`

For this project, I have tried to demonstrate my knowledge of Android development, including some modern technologies.
I have used MVP as a project structure, in order to better split each function.
Using databinding to bind UI views to data change.
Using RxJava to handle asynchronous tasks.
Using Retrofit to implement Api request.
I believe those technologies or knowledge behind those technologies are useful for all projects, very convenient and good to learn.
I didn't focus too much on UI design, for this demo, I think most important thing is the code itself and demonstration of my knowledge. Also the time for this project is arould 12 hours, which is another reason I didn't focus too much on UI.
